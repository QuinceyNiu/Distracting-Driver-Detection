# Distracting Driver Detection Based On Deep Learning.
According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, one in ten fatal crashes and two in ten injury crashes were reported as distracted driver accidents. In an attempt to mitigate these alarming statistics, our program aims to use deep learning technology to detect whether drivers are distracted or not. By doing this, we can give warnings to the monitor as the same time the driver shows some signs of distraction.
